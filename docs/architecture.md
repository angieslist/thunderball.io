# Architecture
## Projects
All thunderball applications share two base dependencies
- **thunderball**: the server side libraries used to build and run a thunderball application
- **thunderball-client**: the client side libraries used to construct modules and provide utilities at run time

The **thunderball-generator** is only used to create a new project.
